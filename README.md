# Autoattendance-Cognitive

This is our group project for face recognition based attendence system. We implemented this system using OpenCV only and the using dlib for face detection and openCV for face recognition but did not get much accuracy.

We then tried using OpenFace but since neural networks require high graphic support, so we failing to get it setup on our computers.

We then used dlib for face detection and microsoft's vision cognitive api for face recognition and got a accuracy of 100% in a classroom of 55 students. We have a video testing of this system in a classroom of 27 students uploaded here : https://youtu.be/FeNasBaXdhg
This accuracy is because of the microsoft's neural network formed on our dataset. We used the camera of the phone OenPlus 3T.

More updates later.
